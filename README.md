# InfoVis-FinalProject
Code repo for information vidualization final project

The main denoising function used in this project is mpdenoise.py
I include a demo notebook showing an example of how this denoising can be applied to diffusion data, this notebook requires the python library dipy in order to download example diffusion images and perform fiber tractogrpahy after denoising.
All code used for data processing can be found in the "processing" folder
